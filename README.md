- 🧠  I recently obtained the Harvard Professional Certificate in Computer Science for Web Programming. [Official Credential Link](https://credentials.edx.org/credentials/c2baa87dfd594781be286140430f59a1)
- 🧠  I enjoy solving complex problems and learning new technologies. My industries include Technology (with expertise in Software Development, Application Development, and Cloud Computing), as well as Pharmaceutical and Healthcare.
- 🧠  Today marks the official end of our Java-SQL-React Full Stack training track. Words cannot express how much I enjoyed and learned during this training. This has been a crucial milestone in my growth as a Full Stack Software Engineer. I am deeply grateful for my cohort and the journey we've shared together. I love you, folks. :)

- Was demoing my voice-assisted AI chatbot during our final project presentation, thinking maybe only I could hear the WebSpeechAPI's response, but it turned out my headset wasn't very soundproof & everyone else in the virtual meeting heard it too, LOL. BTW, I plan to implement more complex voice-assisted features in my future projects to address accessibility issues, which I think is really cool too. :)

- You probably cannot see this, but I'm still grateful for your quick response on the second day of my "graduation" and within minutes of my online application, among hundreds of other applicants. In return for your appreciation, I've decided to invest a substantial amount of energy in learning SwiftUI. :p
- Finally started having fun debugging my MaterialReactTable..
- Once again, I'm excited that I deployed my whole new full-stack app (including the backend, database, frontend) within a few hours while listening to music the entire time, LOL.
- "Good memory doesn't make a good developer; good understanding does."
- "Having been taught so many times that JS is gradually being replaced by TS because the former is dynamically typed, I suddenly wonder why Python, which is also dynamically typed, isn’t being replaced by languages such as Java lol" Oh, I miss everyone I've ever co-coded with..
- I may not remember all their faces, but I remember many of their voices. Q&A sessions (whether formal or informal) were my favorite lol (Oh I remember many of the questions too..)
- I truly appreciate someone who gave me the exciting opportunity to implement a stretch goal feature, which is directly related to the industry project I’m working on right now. 😊
- Invited by the editor of a prestigious journal in my PhD field to review a manuscript & felt deeply honored. Thank you for remembering me. :)
- One Node.js expert promised to help me out if I ever ran into trouble. Now I feel safe, even while doing all the work myself - *that's* the beauty of a Promise (in React).
- "If you don't know what you want, knowing what you don't want is still a step forward."
- I don't know if it's my favorite, but I've definitely spent plenty of time on it: I refactored it from an old monolith to a microservices architecture, then later transformed it into a new monolith (after deploying the microservices). Throughout this journey, I used it to practice deployment, CI/CD, authentication, database interactions, polling, Bootstrap, and more, while performing extensive debugging which significantly improved my proficiency with Django. Now, my next goal is to convert the Django backend into an Express/Node.js backend for seamless integration with the JavaScript/React frontend. I'm so excited about it. (Oh, I immediately realized I probably underestimated the difficulty of this refactor. Django offers so many built-in features that make everything so convenient and "effortless." I still miss Django — I wish I had spent more time using it.)

- The happiest thing in my life is the ability to learn different things from different people. I love talking to people and always learn something new with every conversation. :)
- I’d be satisfied if I could be as comfortable coding as I'm posting. Keep it up, S. lol.
- Having used JavaScript so heavily recently, I feel it would be a waste of energy not to take the opportunity to learn Node.js, which will undoubtedly enhance my JavaScript skills in return.
- While Node.js doesn't come with built-in authentication like Django, it's undoubtedly one of the easiest environments to set up WebSockets thanks to libraries like ws. :p
- I'm glad I finally get to work on the APIs.
- Trying to do password encryption in 10 min...Wish me luck :P 
- Haven't worked with SQL for a while, surprised that I still remember the commands well..:)
- I love my job because it makes me happy. And by 'happy,' I mean debugging for hours but still thinking, 'Wow, I get paid for *this*' 😍😊
- When your “hobby” of collecting certificates aligns perfectly with your job’s requirement 👀
- Snow Day = Work Day (cause cannot go out :p)
- Busy refreshing my Python&AWS memory these days..
- Snow day again, scrolling through this book...for fun. (Someone sent it to me in March or April 2023, I guess?)

- I've been studying elsewhere recently (while on leave). Although I've been primarily preparing for AWS, I found out that I need to pass the Microsoft AZ-900 exam before I can take my AWS exam (bc my employer has already paid for it). Here it is - I got my first cloud certificate (after sitting for a timed, proctored exam today). Onward to the next. :)
- <img width="500" alt="AZ 900" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7104bd5d-18a5-4652-a784-d7ba9c0d3bb2" />
- Passed two proctored exams in three days...😵‍💫 Microsoft AZ900 (on Friday) and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (on Sunday)😅 Onward to the next. :)
- <img width="500" alt="AWS_CCP" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afbbfea4-c842-434d-b8cc-8c61bf5b7ea7" />
- The next one won’t be too soon bc I’m still working as a Full-Stack Developer in the industry (with very limited spare time). I truly appreciate the opportunity to work with AWS on the job though 🙂
- First time opening our team's AWS console after returning from leave—and surprised to realize that I now understand exactly what every part is doing...Used to look at this console every single day and feel like I wasn’t really *seeing* anything. Funny how much difference focused learning makes! 😆 (Next goal: AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate, so I can not only understand each part but also design and optimize it. 🚀☁️)
- I love AI :)
- <img width="500" alt="AI" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/081fa456-f95d-42de-9b58-751cf2cca6da" />

- Arrived at the office before 7 and left after 5 today. Swiped twice, pulled twice - nothing. Just as I was about to push the door open, a colleague on a phone call right behind me said, “There’s a button…” 😵‍💫 BTW, is that a new button?? Because I swear I’ve left this building before..🫣
- Can you believe that if you keep wondering why you’re not seeing someone in the office anymore, they’ll reach out to you out of the blue? 😅
- AI said I am correct, folks 🙂

### How I've Been Reducing Costs Post-Deployment (To Be Continued)

After gaining proficiency in CI/CD processes, my main concern shifted to cost reduction post-deployment, prompted by the substantial Heroku bills I've received over the past few months (one of them as below).

<img src="https://github.com/wsrn829/wsrn829/assets/67284951/03b88c98-3fbe-4bd5-b219-619fbf752115" width="200px">

Below are some of my solutions:

1. Converted the previous Microservices architecture of DealerDashboard into a Monolithic architecture called WheelWorld to reduce costs post-deployment.
2. Replaced Polling in DealerDashboard with HTTP requests in WheelWorld to improve data synchronization efficiency and reduce costs post-deployment.
3. Turned the previous three databases for three microservices in DealerDashboard into one for WheelWorld also to reduce cost post-deployment.
4. // My team project, ThriveTogether, added a "peers" table other than the "users" table to simplify code. My solo project, CodeConnect, created a junction table to take advantage of the referential integrity. However, I'm not quite sure which is more cost-effective for now. //

-----------------------

### How I Taught Myself [*CI/CD - The Most Crucial DevOps Practice.*](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/devops-tutorial/continuous-delivery-and-continuous-deployment)

1. When I set out to enhance my CI/CD skills, I decided to start with TaskTales - my first full-stack app, built with Django and HTML. 
*  Deploying a Django App on Heroku is straightforward if you follow [these steps](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python), although it can require *tricky* troubleshooting.
*  After 112 commits to the TaskTalesDeployment repository, it suddenly started working as smoothly as it did in local development mode, with zero console errors on my end...LOL. 🌸 *My First Independently Deployed Django App on Heroku* 🌸
*  I'll focus on adding features and styling to this app in the future. :)
*  A mandatory pull request has been implemented on the main branch for *Branch Protection*.
-------------------------------------
2. The second app I independently deployed (also on Heroku) is DealerDashboard, which shares similarities with TaskTales but exhibits greater complexity.
* Specifically, the incorporation of microservices, Docker, and polling, along with the React-based frontend, adds a layer of sophistication.
* Deploying an app from scratch presents a valuable opportunity to enhance my understanding of configurations.

[Article 2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/build-a-to-do-application-using-django-and-react)

* Backend is deployed on Heroku. Frontend is deployed on Netlify. I need to connect them and make them fully functioning.

* I'm thrilled to incorporate my [Deployed Car Dealership App](https://dealerdashboard.netlify.app/) into my resume, even as the project continues to evolve.
    
* 🌸 Configuring CI/CD for full-stack apps, which includes setting up front-end and back-end deployment pipelines, managing database migrations, handling environment variables, and numerous debugging, has been quite a challenge. However, the rewarding outcomes make the entire effort absolutely worthwhile! 🌸
  
* After deploying my microservices in minutes, CI/CD is no longer a concern. I will focus on React and AI for future projects.

* I have a comprehensive understanding of this application, including:
  - Backend and frontend code implementation;
  - Interactions with the databases using SQL commands;
  - The CI/CD processes for seamless integration and deployment on Heroku and Netlify;
  - Distributed task processing and scheduling using Celery (with worker processes and Beat scheduler) and Redis as the message broker;
  - Styling and layout design using CSS and Bootstrap.

3. I'm still adding features, but here is my third independently [Deployed Crypto App](https://coin-crest.netlify.app/).

-------------------------------
4. ThriveTogether is a comprehensive, full-stack mental health peer support application, meticulously developed by our team from inception to implementation. The journey began with brainstorming and voting on project ideas, followed by wireframing to design the UI/UX. The entire process was carried out with minimal mentorship, demonstrating our team's self-reliance and technical acumen. We leveraged a robust tech stack including React, Redux Toolkit, FastAPI, OAuth2, JWT, PostgreSQL, Unit Testing, and CI/CD. In this project, I accomplished the following:
    - Rebuilt the Postgres database and refined the database schemas by updating column names and adding Foreign Keys.
  
    - Set up CI/CD pipelines, deployed the project on Heroku (backend) and Netlify (frontend), and connected it to a Postgresql database running on Heroku.
  
    - Implemented Redux Toolkit and Redux Thunk for efficient central state management and handling of asynchronous operations.
  
    - Implemented OAuth2 with JWT tokens for backend authentication, and React's useContext hook for login, logout, registration, and fetching tokens from the API for frontend authentication.
  
    - Developed peer-adding and peer list functionalities utilizing React on the frontend and FastAPI on the backend.
  
    - Developed comprehensive unit tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the application.
  
    - Revamped the landing page design and applied responsive styling for optimal display on both desktop and mobile devices.

-------------------------------------
1. Just my 3rd homework/practice project (6 in total) & already feeling more complex than DealerDashboard (or even ThriveTogether). The final personal/customized project should be more complex than ThriveTogether. (No wonder it says this course is not for beginners, and I'm glad all projects are required to use Django for the backend. I love Django.)
2. No teammate. I tend to spend 24 hours a day on these, but mom calls me to sleep every night.
3. Paid for this course at the end of 2021 when on sale but wasn't able to finish it (a bit too hard back then). It seems I don't need to pay again but may need to resubmit some of the homework (?).
4. My single greatest source of happiness right now.

5. "Up to 3 weeks grading time" turned out to be much faster (maybe the final project will take longer?).

7. Project 4 is a Gmail clone using vanilla JavaScript. God, I thought I would never need to use vanilla JavaScript after learning React but had to write hundreds of lines of JavaScript code without any React TT

8. Project 5 is a Twitter clone. (Idk what it will bring me, but I know I want it.)

9. Oh someone always knows what I'm in need of when working solo TT

11. Wouldn't be me if I ever compromised my standards (?).
    
12. God. I literally set up a whole new authentication system (both frontend and backend) from scratch tonight for the final project and got it working just now. Used Django REST framework for backend auth, React for frontend auth, and useContext for global state management. I think I could reuse this system for all my future Django projects. Authentication is so hard, for sure. Glad I still enjoy it. Good night.
