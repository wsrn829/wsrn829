### How I've Been Reducing Costs Post-Deployment (To Be Continued)

After gaining proficiency in CI/CD processes, my main concern shifted to cost reduction post-deployment, prompted by the substantial Heroku bills I've received over the past few months (one of them as below).

<img src="https://github.com/wsrn829/wsrn829/assets/67284951/03b88c98-3fbe-4bd5-b219-619fbf752115" width="200px">

Below are some of my solutions:

1. Converted the previous Microservices architecture of DealerDashboard into a Monolithic architecture called WheelWorld to reduce costs post-deployment.
2. Replaced Polling in DealerDashboard with HTTP requests in WheelWorld to improve data synchronization efficiency and reduce costs post-deployment.
3. Turned the previous three databases for three microservices in DealerDashboard into one for WheelWorld also to reduce cost post-deployment.
4. My team project, ThriveTogether, added a "peers" table and a "peer_requests" table other than the "users" table to prioritize speed.
5. My solo project, CodeConnect, utilized advanced filtering techniques in Python syntax by using only the "users" table to prioritize cost reduction. 

-----------------------

### How I Taught Myself [*CI/CD - The Most Crucial DevOps Practice.*](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/devops-tutorial/continuous-delivery-and-continuous-deployment)

1. When I set out to enhance my CI/CD skills, I decided to start with TaskTales - my first full-stack app, built with Django and HTML. 
*  Deploying a Django App on Heroku is straightforward if you follow [these steps](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python), although it can require *tricky* troubleshooting.
*  After 112 commits to the TaskTalesDeployment repository, it suddenly started working as smoothly as it did in local development mode, with zero console errors on my end...LOL. üå∏ *My First Independently Deployed Django App on Heroku* üå∏
*  I'll focus on adding features and styling to this app in the future. :)
*  A mandatory pull request has been implemented on the main branch for *Branch Protection*.
-------------------------------------
2. The second app I independently deployed (also on Heroku) is DealerDashboard, which shares similarities with TaskTales but exhibits greater complexity.
* Specifically, the incorporation of microservices, Docker, and polling, along with the React-based frontend, adds a layer of sophistication.
* Deploying an app from scratch presents a valuable opportunity to enhance my understanding of configurations.

* Backend is deployed on Heroku. Frontend is deployed on Netlify. I need to connect them and make them fully functioning.

* I'm thrilled to incorporate my [Deployed Car Dealership App](https://dealerdashboard.netlify.app/) into my resume, even as the project continues to evolve.
    
* üå∏ Configuring CI/CD for full-stack apps, which includes setting up front-end and back-end deployment pipelines, managing database migrations, handling environment variables, and numerous debugging, has been quite a challenge. However, the rewarding outcomes make the entire effort absolutely worthwhile! üå∏
  
* After deploying my microservices in minutes, CI/CD is no longer a concern. I will focus on React and AI for future projects.

* I have a comprehensive understanding of this application, including:
  - Backend and frontend code implementation;
  - Interactions with the databases using SQL commands;
  - The CI/CD processes for seamless integration and deployment on Heroku and Netlify;
  - Distributed task processing and scheduling using Celery (with worker processes and Beat scheduler) and Redis as the message broker;
  - Styling and layout design using CSS and Bootstrap.

3. I'm still adding features, but here is my third independently [Deployed Crypto App](https://coin-crest.netlify.app/).

-------------------------------
4. ThriveTogether is a comprehensive, full-stack mental health peer support application, meticulously developed by our team from inception to implementation. The journey began with brainstorming and voting on project ideas, followed by wireframing to design the UI/UX. The entire process was carried out with minimal mentorship, demonstrating our team's self-reliance and technical acumen. We leveraged a robust tech stack including React, Redux Toolkit, FastAPI, OAuth2, JWT, PostgreSQL, Unit Testing, and CI/CD. In this project, I accomplished the following:
    - Rebuilt the Postgres database and refined the database schemas by updating column names and adding Foreign Keys.
  
    - Set up CI/CD pipelines, deployed the project on Heroku (backend) and Netlify (frontend), and connected it to a Postgresql database running on Heroku.
  
    - Implemented Redux Toolkit and Redux Thunk for efficient central state management and handling of asynchronous operations.
  
    - Implemented OAuth2 with JWT tokens for backend authentication, and React's useContext hook for login, logout, registration, and fetching tokens from the API for frontend authentication.
  
    - Developed peer-adding and peer list functionalities utilizing React on the frontend and FastAPI on the backend.
  
    - Developed comprehensive unit tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the application.
  
    - Revamped the landing page design and applied responsive styling for optimal display on both desktop and mobile devices.

-------------------------------------
1. Just my 3rd homework/practice project (6 in total) & already feeling more complex than DealerDashboard (or even ThriveTogether). The final personal/customized project should be more complex than ThriveTogether. (No wonder it says this course is not for beginners, and I'm glad all projects are required to use Django for the backend. I love Django.)
2. No teammate. I tend to spend 24 hours a day on these, but mom calls me to sleep every night.
3. Paid for this course at the end of 2021 when on sale but wasn't able to finish it (a bit too hard back then). It seems I don't need to pay again but may need to resubmit some of the homework (?).
4. My single greatest source of happiness right now.

5. "Up to 3 weeks grading time" turned out to be much faster (maybe the final project will take longer?).

7. Project 4 is a Gmail clone using vanilla JavaScript. God, I thought I would never need to use vanilla JavaScript after learning React but had to write hundreds of lines of JavaScript code without any React TT

8. Project 5 is a Twitter clone. (Idk what it will bring me, but I know I want it.)

9. Oh someone always knows what I'm in need of when working solo TT

10. "Twitter" done. Final projecting rn.

11. Wouldn't be me if I ever compromised my standards (?).
    
12. God. I literally set up a whole new authentication system (both frontend and backend) from scratch tonight for the final project and got it working just now. Used Django REST framework for backend auth, React for frontend auth, and useContext for global state management. I think I could reuse this system for all my future Django projects. Authentication is so hard, for sure. Glad I still enjoy it. Good night.
