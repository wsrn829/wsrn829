### 1/2 Compare TaskTales and ThriveTogether:
|     |       **TaskTales**           |         **ThriveTogether**                                                        |
|:--------------- |:------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Backend Framework* | Django | FastAPI |
| *Containerization* | Virtual Environment | Docker |
| *Database* | SQLite | PostgreSQL |
| *Frontend* | HTML | React |
| *Authentication* | Built-In | Manual |

All five aspects seem simpler for the former (not saying Django is "easier" than FastAPI, just that I'm better at it at the moment üôÇ);\
hence, when I set out to enhance my deployment skills, I decided to start with TaskTales. [*CI/CD - The Most Crucial DevOps Practice.*](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/devops-tutorial/continuous-delivery-and-continuous-deployment)

*  Django App Deployment on Heroku actually is pretty straightforward if we follow [these steps](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python), although it simply doesn't work as it does locally...Troubleshooting is *tricky*.
*  OMG. I can't believe it...After 112 commits to the Repo (TaskTalesDeployment), it suddenly starts working as smoothly as in the local development mode (with zero console error on my end)...LOL. üå∏ [*My First Independently Deployed Django App on Heroku*](https://tasktales-e12d965b0fbc.herokuapp.com/) üå∏ [01/09/2024]
*  I'll focus on adding features and styling to this app in the future. :)
*  A mandatory pull request has been implemented on the main branch for *Branch Protection*.

### 2/2 Compare DealerDashboard and TaskTales:
|     |       **DealerDashboard**           |         **TaskTales**                                                        |
|:--------------- |:------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Backend Framework* | Django | Django |
| *Database* | PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL |
| *Cloud Platform* | Heroku | Heroku |
| *Authentication* | Built-In | Built-In |
| *Containerization* | Docker | Virtual Environment |
| *Microservices* | Yes | No |
| *Polling* | Yes | No |
| *Frontend* | React | HTML |

I am excited about deploying this app because it shares similarities with TaskTales but exhibits greater complexity.
* Specifically, the incorporation of microservices, Docker, and polling, along with the React-based frontend, adds a layer of sophistication.
* Deploying an app from scratch presents a valuable opportunity to enhance my understanding of configurations.

[This is a helpful resource](https://dev.to/mdrhmn/deploying-react-django-app-using-heroku-2gfa). I wish I had discovered it when deploying my backend in the past two days. However, I managed to figure out the recommended practice on my own anyway. LOL. 

* We kept encountering CORS errors when deploying ThriveTogether, so I would go with the second option for this one.
* The Django-based server and PostgreSQL database are already up and running on Heroku.
* Now, I need to configure the React frontend to display in the browser.
