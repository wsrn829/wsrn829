Hi there üëã My name is Sarina 
==========================

Full Stack Software Engineer
----------------------------

As a dedicated Full-Stack Engineer with over 1000 hours of training in Agile environments, I bring hands-on experience spanning the entire software development lifecycle, from planning to implementation. Proficient in CI/CD processes, I specialize in ensuring smooth software deployments. Thriving in cross-functional teams, I foster collaborative problem-solving to guarantee the timely delivery of high-quality software solutions. Leveraging my background in social science research, I instill a user-centric approach, emphasizing the broader impact of development decisions. *Let's work together to bring your ideas to life!*

My [**portfolio**](http://sarinawuphd.com) showcases proficiency in building responsive user interfaces with modern JavaScript frameworks like React and secure server-side architectures with Django, Python, and FastAPI. My proficiency extends to working with databases such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval. I have successfully implemented CI/CD for projects, incorporating database migrations, environment variable configuration, and extensive debugging to ensure continuous delivery. *Thriving at the forefront of innovation, I am a growth-driven developer, propelled by an insatiable desire for knowledge and mastery.*
* üß†¬† I'm learning React, Redux, AI, and AWS
* üß†¬† I thoroughly enjoyed dedicating my entire spring break last year to improving my Django skills. *Upon reviewing my Django projects, I find that I am still comfortable using them and have recently deployed some of them.*
* ü§ù¬† I'm open to collaborating on AI Projects.

### How I Taught Myself [*CI/CD - The Most Crucial DevOps Practice.*](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/devops-tutorial/continuous-delivery-and-continuous-deployment)

1. When I set out to enhance my CI/CD skills, I decided to start with TaskTales - my first full-stack app, built with Django and HTML. 
*  Deploying a Django App on Heroku is straightforward if you follow [these steps](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python), although it can require *tricky* troubleshooting.
*  After 112 commits to the TaskTalesDeployment repository, it suddenly started working as smoothly as it did in local development mode, with zero console errors on my end...LOL. üå∏ [*My First Independently Deployed Django App on Heroku*](https://tasktales-e12d965b0fbc.herokuapp.com/) üå∏
*  I'll focus on adding features and styling to this app in the future. :)
*  A mandatory pull request has been implemented on the main branch for *Branch Protection*.
-------------------------------------
2. The second app I independently deployed (also on Heroku) is DealerDashboard, which shares similarities with TaskTales but exhibits greater complexity.
* Specifically, the incorporation of microservices, Docker, and polling, along with the React-based frontend, adds a layer of sophistication.
* Deploying an app from scratch presents a valuable opportunity to enhance my understanding of configurations.

* Backend is deployed on Heroku. Frontend is deployed on Netlify. I need to connect them and make them fully functioning.

* üå∏ Configuring CI/CD for full-stack apps, which includes setting up front-end and back-end deployment pipelines, managing database migrations, handling environment variables, and numerous debugging, has been quite a challenge. However, the rewarding outcomes make the entire effort absolutely worthwhile! üå∏
* Look at my drawing for my team (using Excalidraw). This is the wireframe of the Car Dealership App.

* After deploying my microservices in minutes, CI/CD is no longer a concern. I will focus on React and AI for future projects.
* I'm thrilled to incorporate my [Deployed Car Dealership App](https://dealerdashboard.netlify.app/) into my resume, even as the project continues to evolve. To date, this application integrates:
  - Four remote GitHub repositories;
  - Three remote Heroku repositories;
  - One remote Netlify repository;
  - Three PostgreSQL databases on Heroku.

* I have a comprehensive understanding of this application, including:
  - Wireframe design;
  - Backend and frontend code implementation;
  - Interactions with the databases using SQL commands;
  - The CI/CD processes for seamless integration and deployment on Heroku and Netlify;
  - Task scheduling and distributed task processing using Celery (with worker processes and Beat scheduler) and Redis as the message broker;
  - Styling and layout design using CSS and Bootstrap.
